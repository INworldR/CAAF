## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure and configuration
- Development environment setup with comprehensive tooling
- Core dependency management with modern Python packaging

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- **Core BaseAgent Implementation**: Complete abstract base class for all CAAF agents
  - Abstract `BaseAgent` class with Clean Architecture principles
  - Protocol-based `ModelInterface` and `MemoryInterface` for dependency injection
  - Comprehensive conversation management with `ConversationHistory` and `Message` models
  - Robust error handling with specific exception classes (`AgentError`, `AgentInitializationError`, `AgentCommunicationError`, `AgentMemoryError`)
  - Async `chat()` method with retry logic and exponential backoff
  - Memory integration with `add_memory()` and `get_conversation_history()` methods
  - Conversation lifecycle management with automatic storage and retrieval
  - Full type safety with Python 3.11+ type hints and Pydantic models
  - Comprehensive logging integration for debugging and monitoring
  - JSON serialization support for all data structures
  - Agent introspection capabilities with `get_agent_info()` and `get_agent_capabilities()`

- **Data Models and Structures**:
  - `Message` class with UUID identification, timestamps, and metadata support
  - `ConversationHistory` class for managing complete conversation threads
  - Pydantic-based validation and serialization for all data structures
  - Protocol definitions for pluggable model and memory backends

- **Error Handling and Robustness**:
  - Structured exception hierarchy for different failure modes
  - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for API calls
  - Graceful degradation when memory or model services are unavailable
  - Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
  - Comprehensive logging at appropriate levels (debug, info, warning, error)

- **Architecture Foundation**:
  - Protocol-based dependency injection for loose coupling
  - Abstract methods requiring implementation in concrete agent classes
  - Clean separation between conversation management and agent-specific logic
  - Support for agent metadata and configuration management
  - Extensible design for future agent specializations

### Technical Details
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Dependencies**: Pydantic, typing-extensions, uuid, datetime, logging, asyncio
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with protocol-based interfaces
- **Code Quality**: PEP8 compliant, fully typed, comprehensive docstrings
- **Error Handling**: Structured exceptions with proper error propagation
- **Testing Ready**: Designed for easy unit testing and mocking

### Development Environment
- Configured pyproject.toml with modern Python packaging
- Comprehensive development dependencies (pytest, black, mypy, ruff)
- Code quality tools configuration (formatting, linting, type checking)
- Pre-commit hooks setup for consistent code quality
- Testing framework configuration with coverage reporting

## Version History Notes

**Version 0.1.0** marks the foundation release of CAAF with the core agent abstraction. This release establishes the architectural patterns and interfaces that all future agent implementations will follow.

The BaseAgent implementation provides a robust, production-ready foundation for building specialized agents while maintaining consistency across the framework. All future agent types (CodeAgent, ResearchAgent, GeneralAgent) will inherit from this base class.

**Upcoming Features** (planned for 0.2.0):
- Concrete model implementations (ClaudeModel, OllamaModel)
- Persistence layer with JSONL-based conversation storage
- Agent memory system with search capabilities
- Inter-agent communication framework
- CLI interface for agent interaction
